    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) with a strong interest in product development, entrepreneurship, and management. I’m deeply passionate about merging creativity with strategy—whether that’s through building scalable projects or crafting compelling design experiences.</p>
    <p>As a classical Kuchipudi dancer recognized by the Guinness Book of Records, Wonder Book of Records, and Telugu Book of Records, I bring discipline, dedication, and a unique cultural perspective into everything I do.</p>
    <p>I co-founded LEAP (Leadership and Entrepreneurship Awareness Program), an initiative that bridges the gap between aspiring young minds and real-world business leaders. Through LEAP, I’ve interviewed numerous startup founders, entrepreneurs, and industry pioneers to extract actionable insights for students.</p>
    <p>I’ve also led branding and content for Tathastu Life, a psychological counseling center—designing logos, producing videos, and driving communication strategies, while also working in operations and management.</p>
